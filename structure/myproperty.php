Great! Let’s walk through a step-by-step setup to build a Property Listing System using:

✅ WordPress theme: Buildexo

✅ Custom fields: ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)

✅ Listings: Using Custom Post Types

✅ Layouts: Built with Elementor (which Buildexo supports)

✅ Optional filtering: We’ll include search/filter options using plugins

This setup gives you full control and ensures compatibility with your theme (Buildexo).

🔧 STEP 1: Install Required Plugins
✅ Install these plugins:
Plugin	Purpose
ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)	Add custom fields to property listings
Custom Post Type UI	Create the "Property" post type (or do it manually)
Elementor (already part of Buildexo)	Design listing templates
Search & Filter Pro (or FacetWP) (optional)	Filter properties by ACF fields (price, location, etc.)
🏠 STEP 2: Create the “Property” Post Type

Use Custom Post Type UI or add manually to functions.php (child theme):

function register_property_post_type() {
    register_post_type('property',
        array(
            'labels' => array(
                'name' => __('Properties'),
                'singular_name' => __('Property')
            ),
            'public' => true,
            'has_archive' => true,
            'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'properties'),
            'show_in_rest' => true,
            'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
        )
    );
}
add_action('init', 'register_property_post_type');

🧩 STEP 3: Add ACF Fields for Property Listings

Go to Custom Fields > Add New Field Group, then:

✅ Example Fields:
Label	Field Name	Type
Price	price	Number
Location	location	Text
Bedrooms	bedrooms	Number
Bathrooms	bathrooms	Number
Area (sq ft)	area	Number
Gallery	gallery	Gallery
Features	features	Checkbox (e.g. Garden, Pool, Garage)

Assign the field group to: Post Type is equal to Property

Save the field group.

🎨 STEP 4: Build Templates with Elementor
✅ Create a Single Property Template

Go to Templates > Theme Builder > Single

Create a new template for Property

Use dynamic tags to insert:

Title

Featured Image

ACF fields (e.g. price, location)

Gallery

Tip: Use the ACF widget (if using Elementor Pro), or use Dynamic Tag > ACF Field.

Set display conditions: Post Type is Property

✅ Create a Property Archive Page

Create a new page (e.g. “All Properties”)

Use Elementor Posts Widget or a plugin like Anywhere Elementor to create a loop of Property posts.

Display:

Title

Thumbnail

Price (ACF)

Location (ACF)

You can also customize the archive template directly (archive-property.php) if you prefer code.

🔍 STEP 5 (Optional): Add Search & Filter

Use a plugin like:

🔎 Search & Filter Pro (paid but powerful)

Add filters for ACF fields like:

Location (text or dropdown)

Bedrooms / Bathrooms (number ranges)

Price (slider or min/max)

Example shortcode:

[searchandfilter fields="location,bedrooms,bathrooms,price" types="select,number,number,number" post_types="property"]


You can then display filtered results on the same page.

🌐 Final URL structure

All properties:
http://yourdomain.com/properties/

Single property:
http://yourdomain.com/properties/property-title/

Filtered property list (if using filters):
http://yourdomain.com/properties/?bedrooms=3&price_max=500000

✅ Summary of What You’ve Built
Feature	Method
Property listings	Custom Post Type (property)
Custom fields (price, location)	ACF
Frontend layout	Elementor + Theme Builder
Filtering	Optional via Search & Filter Pro or FacetWP
Theme	Buildexo (works well with Elementor)

india prperty api
ChatGPT said:

Yes — there are a few APIs in India (or related to Indian real estate / regulation) and also ways to build or use them. Depending on what exactly you need (listings, verification, valuation, filters, etc.), some will suit more than others. I’ll outline what’s available + how you could use or build one for your property listing + ACF + Buildexo setup.

🔍 Existing Indian APIs / Services

Here are some APIs or services in or relevant to India that you might use:

Name	What it does	Good if you need …	Limitations / Notes
Surepass RERA Verification API	Lets you verify real estate projects/entities registered under the Indian RERA (Real Estate Regulatory Authority) using RERA ID. 
Surepass
+1
	You want to add legitimacy — allow users to check if a project is officially registered.	Doesn't give you full listing / property data. Focused on verification. Subscription or license may be required.
NayaPurana API (Free Property Listing Site & App)	It says “Property sale, rent & leads” via API. 
NayaPurana.in
	If you want ready‑listings / free leads from an existing marketplace.	Might not have all data fields you need; data ownership, freshness, filtering might be limited. Need to check their docs.
Propstack	Indian real estate data & analytics; they maintain a large database of property transactions, rent/sale, etc. Also offer APIs to integrate datasets. 
Propstack
	If you want historical transaction data, analytics, or large‑scale property market insights.	Likely expensive; may have usage restrictions; may not expose full listing API with images etc.
IndiaProperty Data Scraping API (by “RealDataAPI”)	Web scraping / extraction of property listing data from IndiaProperty.com. 
realdataapi.com
	If you want bulk listing data and can accept scraped info. Useful for trend analysis.	Scraping may violate terms of service; data reliability / structure might vary; not always legal; may be delays.
OLX Properties API (partial / unofficial)	Listings for Buy / Rent property on OLX (India) accessible via some endpoints. 
OLX
	If you want a large source of current property listings.	OLX may not expose full public API; many endpoints are meant for their front‑end; usage rights and access may be restricted.
⚙️ What You’ll Probably Need & What to Check

Before using or building a property API, make sure you define or check:

Data fields you need (price, location, area, images, amenities, custom features, etc.).

Freshness & update frequency (how often listings update).

Data licensing / usage rights (are you allowed to re‑use listings, show images, etc.).

Filtering / search: geo / locality / number of bedrooms / price range etc.

Pagination, performance: how many results, how fast, etc.

Costs / limits: free vs paid, monthly quotas, etc.

Legal / Terms: some scraped APIs may violate terms of portals. Using regulated data (like RERA) has rules.

🛠 How to Use With Buildexo + ACF + Your Setup

Assuming you find an API or build your own, here’s a plan to integrate it into your WordPress site with ACF & Buildexo:

Decide whether data is remote API or local stored

You might fetch data on demand via the API.

Or periodically pull them and store in WordPress custom post type (“property”) so you can use ACF, Elementor templates, filtering, etc.

Define your property post type & ACF fields matching the API’s fields, so you can map the API data into your site structure.

Write a WP plugin or custom code to fetch data from API:

For remote: use HTTP request (via wp_remote_get etc.)

For scheduled import: using WP Cron to pull data and update or insert posts.

Templating / Listing: Use Elementor + theme builder (or custom templates) to show the properties, using ACF to show the fields.

Filtering / Search: Use a plugin that can filter by meta fields (ACF fields) and maybe category / taxonomy (e.g. property type, locality). If API supports filters, you can also build those filters in front‑end that call API directly (for remote live search).

Caution with images: If API returns image URLs, ensure you have rights. You might want to download / cache images locally or embed properly.

RERA Verification: If using Surepass or similar, you can add verification badges in your property detail template (if project has a RERA ID, fetch verification via API and show “Verified / Registered” etc.)

💡 Suggestion: Build Your Own Minimal Property API

If existing ones don’t fully match your needs, you can build a minimal API that suits your site, for internal or public use.

Use your WordPress site itself as the backend. Since you already have a custom post type and ACF fields, you can expose a REST API.

WordPress REST API can be extended: you add support for your CPT (“property”) and include the custom fields.

Example:

add_action( 'rest_api_init', function () {
  register_rest_route( 'myproperty/v1', '/listings', [
    'methods' => 'GET',
    'callback' => 'get_property_listings',
    'permission_callback' => '__return_true',
  ] );
} );

function get_property_listings( WP_REST_Request $request ) {
  $args = [
    'post_type' => 'property',
    'posts_per_page' => 10,
    // you can add filter from $request->get_param(...) etc
  ];
  $q = new WP_Query( $args );
  $data = [];
  while ( $q->have_posts() ) {
    $q->the_post();
    $id = get_the_ID();
    $data[] = [
      'id' => $id,
      'title' => get_the_title(),
      'price' => get_field('price', $id),
      'location' => get_field('location', $id),
      'bedrooms' => get_field('bedrooms', $id),
      'images' => get_field('gallery', $id), // or featured image
      'permalink' => get_permalink($id),
    ];
  }
  wp_reset_postdata();
  return rest_ensure_response( $data );
}


Then you can call that endpoint (e.g. /wp-json/myproperty/v1/listings) from your front‑end (Elementor or JS) or mobile app etc.
