You're building a real estate website using your custom theme ("BuildExo") and you want a flow like:

🔄 Desired Flow:

Property Sell / Purchase Page

Button or section for "Sell" or "Buy"

→ Leads to Location Selection Page

Grid/List of locations (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi, etc.)

→ Click on a Location

Leads to Projects/Deals for that Location

This is a common flow for real estate or location-based listing websites. Here's how you can build this system using WordPress, without needing paid plugins — and you can scale it later.

✅ SOLUTION OVERVIEW

You can achieve this using:

✅ Custom Post Types (CPT) — for Projects or Properties

✅ Custom Taxonomies — for Location

✅ Page Templates or Elementor — for Sell, Buy, Location Listings

✅ Optional: Use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) (Free version)

🔨 STEP-BY-STEP SETUP
🔹 Step 1: Create a Custom Post Type: “Projects” or “Properties”

Use a plugin like “Custom Post Type UI” (free) or add code to functions.php:

Example (functions.php):
function buildexo_register_projects_post_type() {
    register_post_type('project', array(
        'label' => 'Projects',
        'public' => true,
        'has_archive' => true,
        'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'projects'),
        'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
        'show_in_rest' => true,
    ));
}
add_action('init', 'buildexo_register_projects_post_type');

🔹 Step 2: Create a Custom Taxonomy: “Location”

This lets you assign each project to a location like “Mumbai”, “Delhi”, etc.

Example (functions.php):
function buildexo_register_location_taxonomy() {
    register_taxonomy('project_location', 'project', array(
        'label' => 'Locations',
        'hierarchical' => true,
        'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'location'),
        'show_in_rest' => true,
    ));
}
add_action('init', 'buildexo_register_location_taxonomy');

🔹 Step 3: Create Pages for:

Sell / Buy Page: Use a page builder or simple HTML with two buttons.

Location Page: List all available locations (terms of project_location)

Individual Location Page: Show all projects for that location.

🔹 Step 4: Dynamically List Locations

Create a page template or use a shortcode to list all terms in project_location.

Example: List Locations with Links
$terms = get_terms(array(
    'taxonomy' => 'project_location',
    'hide_empty' => false,
));

if (!empty($terms)) {
    echo '<ul class="location-list">';
    foreach ($terms as $term) {
        echo '<li><a href="' . esc_url(get_term_link($term)) . '">' . esc_html($term->name) . '</a></li>';
    }
    echo '</ul>';
}


Each location link will take the user to /location/mumbai/ (or whatever slug), which WordPress handles automatically.

🔹 Step 5: Display Projects per Location (Archive Template)

When a user clicks on a location (e.g., /location/mumbai/), WordPress will show all projects assigned to that location.

You can customize the taxonomy archive by creating:

taxonomy-project_location.php


Inside that template:

<?php get_header(); ?>
<h1>Projects in <?php single_term_title(); ?></h1>

<?php
if (have_posts()) :
    while (have_posts()) : the_post();
        // Display your project card here
        the_title('<h2>', '</h2>');
        the_excerpt();
    endwhile;
else :
    echo '<p>No projects found.</p>';
endif;
?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

🚀 Optional Enhancements
✅ Use ACF (Free)

Add custom fields to Projects: price, type, area, contact, etc.

Display them in your templates.

✅ Use Elementor (Free)

Create pages visually.

Use dynamic listings with Elementor + "Elementor Custom Skin" plugin.

✅ Use Filters

If you want filters (e.g., by price, type), use:

FacetWP (Paid) – best for performance

Search & Filter (Free) – works well for small sites

🧩 Summary
Goal	How to Achieve It
Sell/Buy Page	Static or custom page with buttons
Locations Page	List taxonomy terms (project_location)
Location Detail Page	WordPress auto-handles taxonomy archives
Project Listings	Custom Post Type project + taxonomy
Custom Fields (price etc)	Use ACF (free)
Filters	Use “Search & Filter” plugin (optional)

You said:
and every page has search filter as per their category
ChatGPT said:

Got it — you want every page to have a search/filter system, and the filters should adapt based on the category/location/page context. For example:

On the Buy page → filter only buy projects.

On Mumbai location page → filter projects only in Mumbai.

On Commercial Projects page → filter only commercial ones.

✅ Goal: Contextual Search & Filter System

You want:

Filters that change based on category/location/type

Available on all project listing pages

Works with your custom post type ("project")

Compatible with BuildExo theme

🔨 How to Build It (No Paid Plugins Needed)

You can achieve this using:

✅ 1. Custom Post Type (CPT) → project
✅ 2. Custom Taxonomies:

project_location → (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi)

project_type → (e.g., Residential, Commercial)

Optional: project_status → (Buy, Rent, Sell)

✅ 3. Search & Filter Plugin (FREE)

Plugin: Search & Filter – WordPress Filtering Plugin

OR manual custom filter (with PHP form + query)

🧠 How It Works:

The Search & Filter plugin lets you create a form to:

Filter by taxonomy (like Location, Type, Status)

Filter by keywords

Automatically restrict results to current context (e.g., location or type page)

✅ Step-by-Step Setup (Using "Search & Filter" Plugin):
🔹 Step 1: Install the Plugin

Go to:

Plugins > Add New

Search for “Search & Filter”

Install & Activate

🔹 Step 2: Create Your Filter

Go to:

Search & Filter > Add New

Create a filter like this:

Example: Filter for Projects

Post Type: Project

Taxonomies to Filter:

project_location (e.g., Mumbai)

project_type (e.g., Residential)

project_status (e.g., Buy)

Search Box: Optional (for keyword)

Submit Button: Yes

Save it. It will generate a shortcode, like:

[searchandfilter fields="search,project_location,project_type,project_status" post_types="project"]

🔹 Step 3: Place Filter on Every Page

Put this shortcode in your page templates or builder layouts.

For example:

In your archive-project.php or taxonomy-project_location.php:

echo do_shortcode('[searchandfilter fields="search,project_location,project_type,project_status" post_types="project"]');


Or just add it via Elementor/Block Editor using a Shortcode block.

🔹 Step 4: Make It Context-Aware (Smart Filtering)

To make the filter smart:

Use Search & Filter’s dynamic filtering capabilities

OR manually restrict filters based on the current archive

Example:

If you're on /location/mumbai, restrict the filter to Mumbai:

$term = get_queried_object();
if ($term && $term->taxonomy === 'project_location') {
    echo do_shortcode('[searchandfilter fields="project_type,project_status" post_types="project" taxonomy_project_location="'.$term->slug.'"]');
}


This keeps the location fixed but still lets users filter by other fields.

🧩 Optional: Create Filter Templates per Page Type

Buy Page → show filters for Buy projects only

Sell Page → show only Sell projects

Location Page → restrict to selected location

You can pass the default taxonomy via shortcode:

[searchandfilter fields="project_type,project_status" post_types="project" taxonomy_project_status="buy"]

🔧 Want It Manual? (No plugin)

If you don't want a plugin, you can build a form like this:

<form method="get" action="<?php echo site_url('/projects'); ?>">
    <select name="location">
        <option value="">Select Location</option>
        <?php
        $locations = get_terms('project_location');
        foreach ($locations as $loc) {
            echo '<option value="'.$loc->slug.'">'.$loc->name.'</option>';
        }
        ?>
    </select>

    <select name="type">
        <option value="">Select Type</option>
        <?php
        $types = get_terms('project_type');
        foreach ($types as $type) {
            echo '<option value="'.$type->slug.'">'.$type->name.'</option>';
        }
        ?>
    </select>

    <input type="submit" value="Search">
</form>


Then in archive-project.php, modify the query:

$tax_query = array('relation' => 'AND');

if (!empty($_GET['location'])) {
    $tax_query[] = array(
        'taxonomy' => 'project_location',
        'field'    => 'slug',
        'terms'    => sanitize_text_field($_GET['location']),
    );
}

if (!empty($_GET['type'])) {
    $tax_query[] = array(
        'taxonomy' => 'project_type',
        'field'    => 'slug',
        'terms'    => sanitize_text_field($_GET['type']),
    );
}

$args = array(
    'post_type' => 'project',
    'tax_query' => $tax_query,
);

$query = new WP_Query($args);

You said:
project as propertiy 
ChatGPT said:

Thanks for the clarification!

You're treating "Projects" as "Properties", so users are browsing or filtering properties based on:

Sell / Buy / Rent

Location (e.g., Mumbai, Delhi)

Type (e.g., Residential, Commercial)

Possibly Price, Area, Bedrooms, etc.

Let’s rename “project” to property and rework the plan accordingly.

✅ GOAL (Real Estate Flow for "BuildExo" Theme)
Page	Functionality
/buy or /sell	Show properties filtered by sale/rent type
/location/mumbai/	Show properties in Mumbai
/location/mumbai/residential/	Show only residential properties in Mumbai
Search Filters on All Pages	Smart filters that auto-adapt to context
🔨 HOW TO SET IT UP
✅ 1. Rename "Project" to "Property" (Custom Post Type)
In functions.php:
function buildexo_register_property_post_type() {
    register_post_type('property', array(
        'label' => 'Properties',
        'public' => true,
        'has_archive' => true,
        'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'properties'),
        'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
        'show_in_rest' => true,
    ));
}
add_action('init', 'buildexo_register_property_post_type');

✅ 2. Custom Taxonomies
a) Location
register_taxonomy('property_location', 'property', array(
    'label' => 'Location',
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'location'),
    'show_in_rest' => true,
));

b) Property Type (Residential, Commercial, etc.)
register_taxonomy('property_type', 'property', array(
    'label' => 'Type',
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'type'),
    'show_in_rest' => true,
));

c) Sale Type (Buy, Sell, Rent)
register_taxonomy('property_status', 'property', array(
    'label' => 'Status',
    'hierarchical' => true,
    'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'status'),
    'show_in_rest' => true,
));

✅ 3. Add Custom Fields (Price, Bedrooms, Area, etc.)

Use Advanced Custom Fields (ACF) (Free):

Field Group: Property Details

Attach to Post Type: property

Fields:

Price

Area (sq ft)

Bedrooms

Bathrooms

Contact Info

✅ 4. Create Archive Pages
Page	File
All Properties	archive-property.php
Location	taxonomy-property_location.php
Type	taxonomy-property_type.php
Status (Buy/Sell)	taxonomy-property_status.php

Inside those files, query and show properties like:

<?php get_header(); ?>
<h1><?php single_term_title(); ?></h1>

<?php
if (have_posts()) :
    while (have_posts()) : the_post();
        ?>
        <div class="property-card">
            <h2><?php the_title(); ?></h2>
            <div class="price">₹<?php the_field('price'); ?></div>
            <div class="type"><?php the_terms(get_the_ID(), 'property_type'); ?></div>
            <div class="location"><?php the_terms(get_the_ID(), 'property_location'); ?></div>
            <a href="<?php the_permalink(); ?>">View Details</a>
        </div>
        <?php
    endwhile;
endif;
?>
<?php get_footer(); ?>

✅ 5. Add Filters to Every Page
Option A: Use Search & Filter Plugin (Free)

Create a filter:

[searchandfilter 
  fields="search,property_location,property_type,property_status" 
  post_types="property"]


You can also use context-specific filtering:

$term = get_queried_object();

if ($term && $term->taxonomy === 'property_location') {
    echo do_shortcode('[searchandfilter fields="property_type,property_status" post_types="property" taxonomy_property_location="'.$term->slug.'"]');
}

Option B: Manual Filter Form (if you don’t want plugin)

Use <form> with GET and modify the main query based on $_GET.

✅ 6. URLs and Structure

You now have automatic clean URLs like:

/properties/ → all properties

/status/buy/ → buy properties

/location/mumbai/ → properties in Mumbai

/location/mumbai/residential/ → use a combined filter page or taxonomy

✅ OPTIONAL: Advanced Setup

If you want to allow filtering by multiple attributes (like bedrooms, price range, etc.):

Use ACF fields + custom queries

Or use a plugin like:

FacetWP (paid)

WP Grid Builder (paid)

Or continue using Search & Filter Pro for more advanced filters

🧠 Summary
Feature	Tool
Custom Post Type for Properties	property
Taxonomies	property_location, property_type, property_status
Custom Fields (Price, Area)	ACF (free)
Filters on Every Page	Search & Filter plugin OR custom code
URL Structure	Clean, SEO-friendly (e.g., /location/mumbai/)
