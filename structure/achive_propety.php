Yes — a property listing plugin can work together with ACF (Advanced Custom Fields) for a WordPress site built with Buildexo (or any other theme) — but some integration work may be needed. Let me explain how this can be done, what to watch out for, and some plugin suggestions plus tips.

✅ Why it’s possible & what to consider

Buildexo is a WordPress theme (specifically for construction / building / architecture sites) that supports Elementor page builder.

Themes generally control the overall layout, styling, header/footer, and page templates, but you can define your own custom post types (CPTs), custom fields, and listing templates in addition to what the theme provides.

ACF is very flexible: you can use it to add custom fields to any post type (or CPT) and then call those field values in your templates. 
ACF

A property listing plugin often provides features like listing management, search & filters, front-end submission, map integrations, etc. When used with ACF, you can use the plugin’s listing data in combination with your custom fields.

So the key is making sure the property plugin’s layout / templates / shortcodes / hooks can read or display ACF fields (or at least be overridden).

⚠️ Things to watch out for / challenges

The listing plugin might have its own custom fields or database schema. You’ll need to ensure you can merge or map your ACF fields to their fields (or replace some of their fields).

Template override: You may need to override or customize the plugin’s templates (in your child theme or via hooks) so that ACF fields show correctly within the layout.

Search/filter compatibility: If you want to filter listings by your custom ACF fields (for example, “number of bedrooms”, “price”, etc.), the listing plugin must support filtering custom fields (meta queries). Not all do out of the box.

Performance & query complexity: Filtering many custom meta fields can slow down queries if not optimized properly (indexes, caching) on large databases.

Conflicts with the theme: The theme might already use certain layout or post types; ensure there’s no naming conflicts.

🛠 Plugin suggestions & integration methods

Here are some property / listing plugins that are known to work or have good flexibility, with notes on ACF integration:

Plugin	Description	How well it works with ACF / custom fields	Notes / caveats
Property Hive	Full-featured real-estate plugin for WordPress with listing, search, front-end, etc. 
WordPress.org Fon

	It has built-in features and APIs; you can extend it or map custom fields.	Might require custom development to fully integrate ACF fields into search/filter forms.
Property – Real Estate Directory Listing	A directory/classifieds plugin useful for property listing. 
WordPress.org
+1
	It claims customizable fields and compatibility with any theme.	You’ll need to test whether your ACF fields are supported by its listing templates.
Advanced Views (for ACF)	Helps display posts, custom fields, etc. 
WordPress.org Wolof

WordPress.org Corsu

	Good for building views of custom post types and ACF fields	It’s not a full listing plugin (i.e. doesn’t handle front-end submission, etc.), but useful for displaying custom ACF-based listings elegantly.

Also, many people build their own solution:

Create a Custom Post Type called e.g. property (using register_post_type or a plugin like CPT UI).

Use ACF to add custom fields to that CPT (price, location, images, features, etc.).

Build a custom template (e.g. single-property.php and a listing archive template) in your child theme that outputs the fields (using get_field(), the_field(), etc.).

Use a plugin like FacetWP, Search & Filter Pro, or Ajax Filter to allow filtering on ACF fields.

Use Elementor (or theme builder) to design the listing pages and embed the loop, making sure to include dynamic field widgets.

This approach gives you maximum control and ensures it will work well with Buildexo since you're building the templates yourself (or via a child theme).

✅ Conclusion & recommendation for your case

Yes, you can use a property listing plugin with ACF on your Buildexo-based site.

If you prefer a “ready plugin” solution, try Property Hive or Property – Real Estate Directory Listing and test how they handle custom fields.

If you want full control, build your own CPT + ACF fields + custom templates + filtering. This is more work but more flexible.

Whichever approach, use a child theme so you can override templates without breaking when the parent theme updates.

Test thoroughly, especially for search/filter, responsiveness, and performance.

If you like, I can suggest a step‑by‑step setup (plugins + code) specifically for Buildexo + ACF for property listings, or I can show you a demo setup. Do you want me to outline that?

Great! Let’s walk through a step-by-step setup to build a Property Listing System using:

✅ WordPress theme: Buildexo

✅ Custom fields: ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)

✅ Listings: Using Custom Post Types

✅ Layouts: Built with Elementor (which Buildexo supports)

✅ Optional filtering: We’ll include search/filter options using plugins

This setup gives you full control and ensures compatibility with your theme (Buildexo).

🔧 STEP 1: Install Required Plugins
✅ Install these plugins:
Plugin	Purpose
ACF (Advanced Custom Fields)	Add custom fields to property listings
Custom Post Type UI	Create the "Property" post type (or do it manually)
Elementor (already part of Buildexo)	Design listing templates
Search & Filter Pro (or FacetWP) (optional)	Filter properties by ACF fields (price, location, etc.)
🏠 STEP 2: Create the “Property” Post Type

Use Custom Post Type UI or add manually to functions.php (child theme):

function register_property_post_type() {
    register_post_type('property',
        array(
            'labels' => array(
                'name' => __('Properties'),
                'singular_name' => __('Property')
            ),
            'public' => true,
            'has_archive' => true,
            'rewrite' => array('slug' => 'properties'),
            'show_in_rest' => true,
            'supports' => array('title', 'editor', 'thumbnail'),
        )
    );
}
add_action('init', 'register_property_post_type');

🧩 STEP 3: Add ACF Fields for Property Listings

Go to Custom Fields > Add New Field Group, then:

✅ Example Fields:
Label	Field Name	Type
Price	price	Number
Location	location	Text
Bedrooms	bedrooms	Number
Bathrooms	bathrooms	Number
Area (sq ft)	area	Number
Gallery	gallery	Gallery
Features	features	Checkbox (e.g. Garden, Pool, Garage)

Assign the field group to: Post Type is equal to Property

Save the field group.

🎨 STEP 4: Build Templates with Elementor
✅ Create a Single Property Template

Go to Templates > Theme Builder > Single

Create a new template for Property

Use dynamic tags to insert:

Title

Featured Image

ACF fields (e.g. price, location)

Gallery

Tip: Use the ACF widget (if using Elementor Pro), or use Dynamic Tag > ACF Field.

Set display conditions: Post Type is Property

✅ Create a Property Archive Page

Create a new page (e.g. “All Properties”)

Use Elementor Posts Widget or a plugin like Anywhere Elementor to create a loop of Property posts.

Display:

Title

Thumbnail

Price (ACF)

Location (ACF)

You can also customize the archive template directly (archive-property.php) if you prefer code.

🔍 STEP 5 (Optional): Add Search & Filter

Use a plugin like:

🔎 Search & Filter Pro (paid but powerful)

Add filters for ACF fields like:

Location (text or dropdown)

Bedrooms / Bathrooms (number ranges)

Price (slider or min/max)

Example shortcode:

[searchandfilter fields="location,bedrooms,bathrooms,price" types="select,number,number,number" post_types="property"]


You can then display filtered results on the same page.

🌐 Final URL structure

All properties:
http://yourdomain.com/properties/

Single property:
http://yourdomain.com/properties/property-title/

Filtered property list (if using filters):
http://yourdomain.com/properties/?bedrooms=3&price_max=500000

✅ Summary of What You’ve Built
Feature	Method
Property listings	Custom Post Type (property)
Custom fields (price, location)	ACF
Frontend layout	Elementor + Theme Builder
Filtering	Optional via Search & Filter Pro or FacetWP
Theme	Buildexo (works well with Elementor)
